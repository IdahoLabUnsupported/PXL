# PXL: Interactive Images in Unity and MRTK3


<b> Pixel eXtraction via Location tracking </b> (PXL) is an additional Unity package built on Microsoft's Mixed Reality Toolkit 3 framework for extended reality (XR) applications.
<br><br>
The code fetches an image, a button behind the image detects user touch via Unity cues, converts 3D input to pixel space and retrieves the corresponding pixel position. Images displayed as sprites aren't interactive by default, and this package aims to address that issue. 

# To Install
<b><i> Make sure that your Unity project has MRTK 3 and required dependencies all installed before proceeding.</i></b> <br> 
If you are new to Unity, follow Microsoft's setup instructions here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/mrtk3-overview/getting-started/setting-up/setup-new-project<br><br>

Download this repo and unzip it. Navigate to the package manager under "Window" -> "Package Manager" in Unity. Select "Add package from disk". Find where you unzipped your package, and click the "manifest.json" file. 

# To Set Up
This package comes with various scripts that work together to get the pixel coordinate.
